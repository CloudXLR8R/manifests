                      may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this
                      time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted

                      termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that

                      (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod
                      from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object
                      may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator
                      or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.

    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # The Revision ContainerConcurrency field specifies the maximum number
    # of requests the Container can handle at once. Container concurrency
    # target percentage is how much of that maximum to use in a stable
    # state. E.g. if a Revision specifies ContainerConcurrency of 10, then
    # the Autoscaler will try to maintain 7 concurrent connections per pod
    # on average.
    # Note: this limit will be applied to container concurrency set at every
    # level (ConfigMap, Revision Spec or Annotation).
    # For legacy and backwards compatibility reasons, this value also accepts
    # fractional values in (0, 1] interval (i.e. 0.7 ⇒ 70%).
    # Thus minimal percentage value must be greater than 1.0, or it will be
    # treated as a fraction.
    # NOTE: that this value does not affect actual number of concurrent requests
    #       the user container may receive, but only the average number of requests
    #       that the revision pods will receive.
    container-concurrency-target-percentage: "70"

    # The container concurrency target default is what the Autoscaler will
    # try to maintain when concurrency is used as the scaling metric for the
    # Revision and the Revision specifies unlimited concurrency.
    # When revision explicitly specifies container concurrency, that value
    # will be used as a scaling target for autoscaler.
    # When specifying unlimited concurrency, the autoscaler will
    # horizontally scale the application based on this target concurrency.
    # This is what we call "soft limit" in the documentation, i.e. it only
    # affects number of pods and does not affect the number of requests
    # individual pod processes.
    # The value must be a positive number such that the value multiplied
    # by container-concurrency-target-percentage is greater than 0.01.
    # NOTE: that this value will be adjusted by application of
    #       container-concurrency-target-percentage, i.e. by default
    #       the system will target on average 70 concurrent requests
    #       per revision pod.
    # NOTE: Only one metric can be used for autoscaling a Revision.

    # The requests per second (RPS) target default is what the Autoscaler will
    # try to maintain when RPS is used as the scaling metric for a Revision and
    # the Revision specifies unlimited RPS. Even when specifying unlimited RPS,
    # the autoscaler will horizontally scale the application based on this
    # target RPS.
    # Must be greater than 1.0.
    # NOTE: Only one metric can be used for autoscaling a Revision.
    requests-per-second-target-default: "200"

    # The target burst capacity specifies the size of burst in concurrent
    # requests that the system operator expects the system will receive.
    # Autoscaler will try to protect the system from queueing by introducing
    # Activator in the request path if the current spare capacity of the
    # service is less than this setting.
    # If this setting is 0, then Activator will be in the request path only
    # when the revision is scaled to 0.
    # If this setting is > 0 and container-concurrency-target-percentage is
    # 100% or 1.0, then activator will always be in the request path.
    # -1 denotes unlimited target-burst-capacity and activator will always
    # be in the request path.
    # Other negative values are invalid.
    target-burst-capacity: "200"

    # When operating in a stable mode, the autoscaler operates on the
    # average concurrency over the stable window.
    # Stable window must be in whole seconds.
    stable-window: "60s"

    # When observed average concurrency during the panic window reaches
    # panic-threshold-percentage the target concurrency, the autoscaler
    # enters panic mode. When operating in panic mode, the autoscaler
    # scales on the average concurrency over the panic window which is
    # panic-window-percentage of the stable-window.
    # Must be in the [1, 100] range.
    # When computing the panic window it will be rounded to the closest
    # whole second, at least 1s.

    # I.e with value of 2.0 the number of pods can at most go N to 2N

    # This is the upper limit and is provided not to enforce timeout after
    # the revision stopped receiving requests for stable window, but to
    # ensure network reprogramming to put activator in the path has completed.
    # If the system determines that a shorter period is satisfactory,
    # then the system will only wait that amount of time before scaling to 0.
    # NOTE: this period might actually be 0, if activator has been
    # in the request path sufficiently long.

    scale-to-zero-grace-period: "30s"

    # Active
    #   * Revisions which are referenced by a Route are considered active.
    #   * Individual revisions may be marked with the annotation
    #      "knative.dev/no-gc":"true" to be permanently considered active.
    #   * Active revisions are not considered for GC.
    # Retention
    #   * Revisions are retained if they are any of the following:
    #       1. Active
    #       2. Were created within "retain-since-create-time"
    #       3. Were last referenced by a route within
    #           "retain-since-last-active-time"
    #       4. There are fewer than "min-non-active-revisions"
    #     If none of these conditions are met, or if the count of revisions exceed
    #      "max-non-active-revisions", they will be deleted by GC.
    #     The special value "disabled" may be used to turn off these limits.
