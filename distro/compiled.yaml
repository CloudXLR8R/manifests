                      may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this
                      time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted

                      termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that
                      30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
                      (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod
                      from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object
                      may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator
                      or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.

                      is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may
                      not be unset or be set further into the future, although it
                      may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this
                      time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted
                      in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful
                      termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that
                      30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
                      (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod
                      from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object
                      may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator
                      or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.
                      If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.  Populated
                      by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

                      can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order,
                      then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible
                      for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal
                      (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component
                      responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in
                      a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to
                      order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering

                                          The reason for termination is passed to
                                          the handler. The Pod''s termination grace
                                          period countdown begins before the PreStop
                                          hooked is executed. Regardless of the outcome
                                          of the handler, the container will eventually
                                          terminate within the Pod''s termination
                                          grace period. Other management of the container
                                          blocks until the hook completes or until
                                          the termination grace period is reached.

                                          resource contention, etc. The handler is
                                          not called if the container crashes or exits.
                                          The reason for termination is passed to
                                          the handler. The Pod''s termination grace
                                          period countdown begins before the PreStop
                                          hooked is executed. Regardless of the outcome
                                          of the handler, the container will eventually
                                          terminate within the Pod''s termination
                                          grace period. Other management of the container
                                          blocks until the hook completes or until
                                          the termination grace period is reached.

                                          which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded
                                          will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC
                                          will be deleted together with the pod.  The
                                          name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume
                                          name>` where `<volume name>` is the name
                                          from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry.
                                          Pod validation will reject the pod if the
                                          concatenated name is not valid for a PVC
                                          (for example, too long). \n An existing
                                          PVC with that name that is not owned by
                                          the pod will *not* be used for the pod to
                                          avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake.
                                          Starting the pod is then blocked until the
                                          unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created
                                          PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the
                                          PVC has to updated with an owner reference
                                          to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                          this should not be necessary, but it may
                                          be useful when manually reconstructing a

                                  its resource allocation, the pod may be evicted.

    1. Do not use kubectl to edit this configmap, because some values are used
    during kustomize build. Instead, change the configmap and apply the entire
    kustomize manifests again.
    2. After updating the configmap, some deployments may need to be restarted
    until the changes take effect. A quick way to restart all deployments in a
    namespace: `kubectl rollout restart deployment -n <your-namespace>`.
